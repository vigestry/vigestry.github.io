      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;-week-from-june-25-to-july-1&#34;&gt;ðŸ“Œ Week from June 25 to July 1&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main topic of this week was the exam session. The atmosphere was tense but exciting: for the first time, I had to take several serious exams in a row.&lt;br&gt;
What stood out the most was preparing for the mathematics exam â€” I had to review my notes and solve dozens of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Business Informatics exam turned out to be less difficult than expected: most questions focused on theory and examples of real-world applications in companies.&lt;br&gt;
It really feels like the first year of studies is reaching an important milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
